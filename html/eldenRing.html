          <p class="paragraph">
            Elden Ring's open world is a masterpiece in visual storytelling:
            from the haunted, foggy swamps of Liurnia, the rot-infested
            hellscape of Caelid, the horrors of the Volcano manor and the
            war-torn royal capital with its mighty Erdtree and the ethereal,
            sorrowful beauty of the Haligtree. As is the case with all From
            Software games, Elden Ring truly excels in boss design. These games
            are well known for featuring little dialogue and almost no
            exposition, leaving the visual design of bosses to do most of the
            work in telling their story. This can be observed most noticeably in
            the main bosses of the game, the shard bearers. Godrick, the first
            of these bosses, is portrayed as a weak and despicable man, forced
            to resort to the grafting of limbs to his flesh to increase his
            strength. His in-game model is a grotesque amalgamation of limbs of
            different sizes which Godrick has taken from his victims, the theme
            of stolen power is furthered in the fight, when Godrick resorts to
            using the head of a dead dragon to kill you.

            Melania can be seen to have been eaten away by the scarlet rot,
            indicated by her missing limbs and blackened flesh. Parts of her
            body have been replaced by golden and immaculately wrought
            prosthesis, a gift given by her twin who was cursed in a separate
            way. Her second phase involves the release of this rot. She unfurls
            giant wings made of teeming swarms of butterflies and turns the rot
            inside her against you in a desperate attempt to win. The last time
            she released this power on an enemy (the great Radahn) she destroyed
            both his mind and an entire ecosystem in her wake. Rykard, in a bid
            for unimaginable power, has fed himself to a great serpent, creating
            a horrifying, bloated snake with human arms and legs. Rykard's face
            can be seen pressing out of the back of the serpents head, human
            flesh overlain by reptilian scales.

            Radahn, a once grand warrior who has been reduced to no better than
            a beast by the scarlet rot his demi-god cousin released. A warrior
            who inspired so much loyalty in his time that there is an entire
            festival of warriors dedicating their lives to putting him out of
            his misery. He uses the many spears lodged in his back by his failed
            assailants as great arrows to launch at you. He has mastered gravity
            magic and uses his power to reduce his mighty weight so that his old
            scraggly horse Leonard may still bear him into battle. Ranni is not
            a boss, but her character model speaks to her intent to not to play
            by the rules of the cosmic game Elden Ring establishes. She has
            slain her original royal flesh, discarding it and taking up
            residence in a simple doll, thus freeing her to pursue her own
            master plan
