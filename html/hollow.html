        Hollow Knight is an indie metroidvania developed by Team Cherry and
        released in 2017. With a team 3 people plus one composer Team Cherry has
        created a shining beacon of what a videogame can be. With a breathtaking
        visual style, varied and dynamic enemies, some of the most celebrated
        boss fights outside if a Miyazaki title and a soundtrack that has been
        of of my most listed to albums for 4 years straight. While Hollow Knight
        knocks it out of the park with every aspect of the game, I believe that
        its defining feature would be the design and execution of its various
        environments.<br />
        The game is set within the lands of Hollownest, a once great
        civilisation brought low by the grim combination of being abandoned by
        their god king and a blight that reduces the noble bugs of Hollownest to
        mere beasts. With the thematic guidelines of each area of this game once
        having been part of this grand kingdom, Team Cherry manges to create a
        plethora of unique and memorable areas that still manage to combine
        towards a cohesive wholes. While Team Cherry uses countless methods in
        order to make these areas such an important aspect of the game, their
        are 3 specific techniques that stand out to me. Those 3 are the use of
        distinct colour and lighting levels to visually separate each level,
        different musical tracks in order to have auditory separation and the
        use of in world logic in order to create a greater sense of adventure.

      <h2 id="t2a">Colour</h2>
      <p class="p2">
        From the soft blues and grays in the “City of Tears” that invoke a sense
        of loss and melacholy to the vibrant greens of the aptly named “Green
        path” that creates a feeling of jaunty adventure. Hollow Knight also
        utilises where the lighting in each scene to direct the player both
        physically and psychologically, Team Cherry will dim all light sources
        bar a luminous glow from the main character in order to create a feeling
        of isolation or have lamp posts subtly guiding you along the intended
        path.
      </p>
      <h2 id="t2b">Music</h2>
      <p class="p2">
        Each area of this world is also companioned with a beautiful piece
        written and composed by Christopher Larkin. Each area has a distinct
        theme that is somehow both able to fade into the background during the
        more action packed exploration focused aspects of the game and yet rise
        to the forefront during the more introspective areas, such as when you
        are resting at a bench. On top of Christopher Larkins beautiful ambient
        music his boss themes tend to blow your breath away, with a special
        mention for the Mantis Lords fight which uses a harpsichord and slaps.

      <h2 id="t3">Cohesive Worldbuilding</h2>
      <p id="p3">
        As for how in world logic affects the environments of the game, I
        believe that when you the player are able to understand and parse the
        reason and logic behind the placement of areas it both creates a deeper
        level of investment and also a greater sense of adventure. For examples
        the City a Tears a crumbling once great metropolis is an underground
        City where it constantly rains. Having the centre of this civilisation
        be a rainy and sober forgotten grave is very interesting but what truly
        increases your deep appreciation for the level of detail in this game
        and your own sense of adventure is when you explore the blue lake
        directly above the city of tears and realise why is is constantly
        raining ( its because theirs a lake above it).
